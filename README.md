## 🚀 Deploy on Render

This project is configured as a Render Static Site through [`render.yaml`](./render.yaml).

### One-click Blueprint setup

1. Push the project to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.
2. In [Render](https://render.com), select **New → Blueprint**.
3. Connect the repository and select the branch containing `render.yaml`.
4. Click **Apply**. Render will run `npm ci && npm run build` and publish the `dist` folder.

The configuration includes a SPA rewrite so refreshing routes such as `/quiz` and `/topics/diabetes` works correctly in production.

### Manual setup

If you prefer to create the service manually, choose **Static Site** and use:

| Setting | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Build Command | `npm ci && npm run build` |
| Publish Directory | `dist` |

Add a rewrite rule from `/*` to `/index.html` with the **Rewrite** action.

## 📋 Academic Presentation Notes

This project is tailored for an academic or college healthcare IT presentation:
1. **Clinical Accuracy**: Content is structured according to clinical guidelines (AHA, ADA, WHO) while maintaining 8th-grade reading level accessibility.
2. **Pedagogical Workflow**: The **"Read. Interact. Learn. Test Your Knowledge."** pipeline promotes active recall and high retention.
3. **Architecture Scalability**: Zero hardcoded UI strings; all condition data, quiz questions, and tools are decoupled into reusable data models ready for future backend/API integration.
4. **Offline Resilience**: Quiz scores, progress, and historical attempts persist locally via the Web Storage API (`localStorage`).
